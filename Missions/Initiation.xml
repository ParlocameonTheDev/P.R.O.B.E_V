#PLAYERNAME#,

The organization needs you again. A new threat has risen to destroy what we love forever. We need your skills once again, my old friend. Anyways, #PLAYERNAME#, if you choose to rejoin, things will never be the same...

You will help save the entire internet.

We must make haste. Reply to this email as soon as possible!
